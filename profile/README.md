## CoMSES Net Educational Initiatives

### Training Modules, Assessments, and Certification on Good Practices for Computational Modeling

We are developing training modules, assessments, and certificates and badges on good practices for computational modeling. These include making models FAIR, how to use version control (Git/GitHub), performing robust sensitivity analyses over model outputs, and how to containerize your models for easier transitions from local development and testing to high performance compute, high throughput compute, or the ☁️. If you'd like to help us pilot these materials and provide early feedback, please [contact us](https://www.comses.net/about/contact/)!

### Codebase Augmentation Pilot Project

We are collecting a diverse set of computational models from different domains with different input / output characteristics and manually augmenting them to be more FAIR (if needed) and to add containerization that supports execution on the [Open Science Grid](https://opensciencegrid.org/). If you'd like to submit a computational model for consideration for our codebase augmentation pilot project, please [let us know!](https://www.comses.net/about/contact/)
